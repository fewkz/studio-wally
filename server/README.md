# Studio Wally Server

This is the code for the backend of studio wally that handles requests to install packages and starts a rojo server for serving those packages. I run an up to date version of this server at https://studio-wally.fewkz.com that you're free to use.

## Setting up

### Prerequisites
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl/)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/)
- A kubernetes cluster to deploy to

### Deploying

You can deploy the backend using Skaffold by doing `skaffold run`. Skaffold requires a image registry to upload the built images to. You can use GitHub for this by passing the `--default-repo ghcr.io/USERNAME/studio-wally` arg. You'll also need to [authenticate with the GitHub container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry).

You'll also need to expose this service to the internet yourself. I'd recommend using cloudflare tunnels. You'll still have to open ports in order for the rojo servers to be connected to.

## Wally Server

Wally server is a docker image that installs wally packages provided to it as arguments and serves a rojo project with the packages.
You can run the wally-server by doing
```sh
docker run -p 34872:34872 -it ghcr.io/fewkz/studio-wally/wally-server \
'promise = "evaera/promise@4.0.0"' 'testez = "roblox/testez@0.4.1"'
```
